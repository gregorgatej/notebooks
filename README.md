This repository contains Jupyter notebooks, covering distinct topics I've been researching.

## Notebooks

### Vector search optimization using NVIDIA Nsight Systems

This notebook focuses on optimizing vector search operations by comparing implementations such as Faiss, cuVS, and CuPy. It uses NVIDIA Nsight Systems for profiling and performance analysis to enhance GPU-accelerated nearest neighbor search speed and scalability.

### Detecting near duplicates using Jaccard similarity and MinHashing

Explores methods to detect near duplicates in data using Jaccard similarity and MinHashing techniques.

### Topic Modeling of Austrian Reddit Posts Using BERTopic*

Demonstrates the use of BERTopic for topic modeling on Reddit posts related to Austria, from the period of the 2024 European Parliament elections. It includes data preprocessing, topic extraction, and visualization of topic trends over time. The analysis uncovers key themes in the Reddit dataset, leveraging statistical learning and unsupervised clustering of keywords.
